My name is Will J, and this is my site!

The projects below are basically a collection of essays I wrote just for the sake of solidifying some thoughts into words.

Feel free to email me at `willj (at this site)` if you have any questions or comments!

A bit about me: I'm from Seattle, and I have a husband, two birds, and a master's in physics ^[I had intended to get a PhD, but it turns out that I am not the right combination of smart and emotionally stable for academia.]. Currently I work as a software engineer for money, and in my spare time I read, play factory games for which I always do all the math, subscribe to a bunch of streaming platforms, and sometimes have an idea that feels worth writing down.

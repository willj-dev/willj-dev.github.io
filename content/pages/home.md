My name is Will J, and this is my site! I am a software engineer, physicist, mathematician, teacher, and functional programming enthusiast. Below are links to some of my independent programming projects, as well as some writing projects hosted here on this site.

Here is a collection of bonus facts about me:

- I've been married to my husband since 2021
- We have three parrots: a Timneh African grey and two cockatiels
- When I play factory games, I _always_ do the math

Feel free to email me at `willj (at this site)` if you have any questions or comments!

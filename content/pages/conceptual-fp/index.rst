title: Conceptual Guide to Functional Programming
project-id: conceptual-fp
blurb: >
  A collection of pages amounting to a smallish book which hopes to provide intuitive motivation for functional programming concepts which might otherwise mystify interested learners. This is done in terms of a "pseudo-ML" toy language which is definitely not Haskell.

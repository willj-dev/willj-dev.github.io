title: Geometric Physics
------------------------

This is a formulation of both modern physics "paradigms" (general relativity and quantum field theory) in the language of geometric algebra. These are usually taught as being famously "un-unitable", but that conception can be avoided if we treat the process of *renormalization* as an important algebraic feature in its own right, which can be given an equally important physical interpretation. The idea is to interpret renormalization representing nothing less than the connection between the "wave picture" of QFT and the "particle picture" of general relativity; 
 
(what about strings? if ads/cft is right, maybe the study of string theories can reveal things about the corresponding cft!)

  Investigating the extent to which reality seems to follow patterns that can be written in the language of geometric algebra.
------------------------

Since we name-dropped "reality", we will first need to ground ourselves in a bit of metaphysics so that it is clear exactly what we mean when we say that reality "follows" these patterns.

The ultimate goal is to (we hope) find a minimal set of "physical axioms" in the language of geometric algebra from which we can derive verifiable results for...pretty much anything. For instance, if we take as an axiom the least-action principle of classical mechanics, we can predict many types of particle trajectories. The metaphysics is helpful in this case to give the reader an appropriate sense of the importance of statements like this; planets (almost) follow such trajectories in a gravitational potential, but they are clearly not point particles; what is the correct way to interpret these axioms, and for that matter what happens when they are only "almost" right?

Another important meta-physical phenomenon which

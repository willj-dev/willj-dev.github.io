title: Geometric Physics
------------------------

This is a formulation of both modern physics ``paradigms'' (general relativity and quantum field theory) in the language of geometric algebra. These are usually taught as being famously "un-unitable", but that conception can be avoided if we treat the process of \emph{renormalization} as an important algebraic feature in its own right, which can be given an equally important physical interpretation. The idea is to interpret renormalization representing nothing less than the connection between the ``wave picture'' of QFT and the ``particle picture'' of general relativity; 
 
(what about strings? if ads/cft is right, maybe the study of string theories can reveal things about the corresponding cft!)

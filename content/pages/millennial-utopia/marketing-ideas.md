## Conceptual Diagrams & Illustrations

### Government Transparency

Government as a big glass box with one tiny safe labeled "personal information". Hopefully that is a narrow enough phrase not to imply anything more than names, addresses, contact info, and employment info

### Distribution of Resources

Cross section of a tree with a comparatively small root system. Ground is literally the earth. Roots are MUG, directing how much stuff needs to come out of the ground to support the tree on top. Above ground part is labeled "social development", and is divided in half vertically. One side is "public funding" and illustrates (somehow) a spectrum between "science" and "art" . The other half is "private ventures" and is made up of a whole lot of teeny branches in organic (but not completely chaotic) growth.

Also, compare to the (ahem) capitalism tree

## Snappy quotes

- Seizing the means of production is uncivilized; we should just let people choose a better way to use it.

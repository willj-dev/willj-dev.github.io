Section 1 - Rights for the Third Millennium
******************************************************

These `rights` belong equally to every `person` in any `high-technology` human `society`. It is the duty of all persons to extend the status and rights of personhood to the largest possible number of individuals.

Article 1 - Self Determination
====================================

Each `person` has the right to complete personal `agency`, to the extent that their actions do not maliciously or negligently harm the rights of any other person.

The range of activities covered by the right to self-determination could never be exhaustive, but historically relevant examples include:

- Speech, writing, and other forms of self-expression
- Pursuit of knowledge or spirituality
- Movement and travel
- Association with, or disassociation from, any number of societies of any size
- Gathering peacefully or in amiable competition
- Fair compensation for employment
- Fair trade in goods, services, or financial resources in an open market

Article 2 - Physical Safety
====================================

No `person` should suffer physical harm which is within any person’s power to prevent, including:

* injury or death due to another person’s malice or negligence;
* lack of access to competent `health care`;
* lack of access to adequate `nutrition`; or
* loss of a `sustainable environment`.

Article 3 - Emotional Safety
====================================

No `person` should suffer psychological harm which is within any person’s power to prevent, including:

* justified fear of violation of personal rights due to another person’s malice or negligence
* mistaken awareness of objective reality due to malicious deception or negligent purveyance of misinformation; or
* distress due to another person’s aggressive or threatening behavior.

Article 4 - Personal Livelihood
====================================

Each `person` should have equal access to:

* private long- or short-term `residence` which is reliable, sanitary, and safe;
* `basic utilities`; and
* genuine consideration for any employment they could reasonably perform.

Article 5 - Personal Privacy
====================================

No `person` should be subject to violation of personal privacy without their informed consent or a legal warrant. This includes:

* search or seizure of any individual or their personal effects;
* search or seizure of data or physical objects in any residence; or
* any use of personally identifiable information outside that person’s direct control.


Article 6 - Participation in Government
==========================================

Each `person` should have an equal opportunity to:

* vote for constitutional amendments in any `government` they are a `citizen` of;
* vote for government officers who represent a fair proportion of the total citizenship; and
* participate in a jury.

Article 7 - Governmental Abuse
====================================

No `person` should be subject to `governmental` abuse of the `law`, including the failure to uphold `due process` equally for all persons.

Section 2 - Human Personhood
*************************************************

All individuals of the human species are automatically `persons`, regardless of national origin, ancestry, race, religion, sexual characteristics, or any other individual or group distinction, so long as they are capable of demonstrating any level of personal agency. In general, all humans should be assumed to have complete personal `agency`; however, in specific cases where that is impossible or impractical, it may be limited:

* Any human embryo or fetus being carried in another human’s womb cannot demonstrate personal agency until they are capable of surviving outside the womb. The availability of competent professionals to provide the following services falls under the personal right to health care:
    * A pregnant human may choose to terminate their pregnancy at any time for any reason.
    * Whenever possible at the time a pregnancy is terminated, the embryo or fetus should be kept alive and healthy in vitro, or with any other type of care which is necessary and practical, and assigned suitable `guardianship`.
* `Children` are allowed to have their personal agency limited by their `guardian`, to the extent that it provides for that child’s personal development and does not result in physical or emotional harm to that child or any other person.
    * Children are required to live with at least one guardian. Whenever this is proven, by due legal process, to cause unreasonable physical or emotional harm to any person, the government is responsible for arranging for new and suitable guardianship.
    * The government may require children to attend school to ensure that they develop into well-informed and competent `adults`. Children who have not yet completed compulsory education may be prevented from voting or running for elected office.
* A human who is profoundly disabled to the extent that it limits their ability to consistently demonstrate personal agency may be assigned an individual care program managed by the government. This care must always maintain the highest practicable level of personal agency for each person.

title: A Millennial Utopia
blurb: >
  A collection of pages describing a form of post-capitalist society, and exploring the extent to which it could be achieved sometime in the Third Millennium.

Core Principles
****************

The core philosophy behind TMS is `The Millennial Social Code`_, which defines a set of rights that we believe belong equally to every person. We also think that it is possible to guarantee those equal rights to everyone in any high-tech human society since the dawn of the contemporary era near the start of the third millennium AD. `A Millennial Utopia`_ is an essay illustrating our vision of such a society, if one already existed on Earth in 2021. Actually getting there without violence or coercion will be (you guessed it) a long process, possibly taking more than one generation, but we believe that’s possible too! Check out `Transitioning From Capitalism`_ for an overview of what it would look like. 

Is it possible?
***************

We’re pretty sure, but we’re working on gathering enough data to prove that before becoming official!

Our fundamental (as yet unproven) assertion  is this: in a high-tech society, there is enough industry and automation that not everyone needs to work on basic goods and services to keep everyone housed, fed, healthy, and\-\-last but certainly not least\-\-otherwise free to go about their lives without having to worry about losing any of those benefits. 

For more information about how we intend to prove this assertion, check out `Proving MU Viability`_.

Outside of basic goods and services guaranteed by TMS (or any government which upholds the Millennial Social Code), any other social development (science, ice cream parlors, art exhibits, roller coaster parks…) can still be provided by an open market without requiring the capitalist system of investment bankers and shareholder dividends. That system has enabled horrific acts of exploitation, corruption, and abuse throughout human history, and continues to do so throughout contemporary human civilization as well. You can find much more information about how that happens, and how a hypothetical Millennial Utopia can protect itself from such abuses, in the essay `Equitable Management and Distribution of Shared Resources`_.

Here are some other articles which help to illustrate some of the concepts underlying TMS and its mission:

`Selected Utopian Social Principles`_ - A smattering of smaller essays and blurbs relevant to our vision of a just society and how such a society is governed.

`The Millennial Utopian Constitution`_ - This is the template for our own internal governance, as well as being a model for any modern representative democracy, from PTA meetings to nation-states.

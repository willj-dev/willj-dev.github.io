# willj-dev.github.io

My name is Will J, and this is the source code for my [site](https://willj.dev)!

Everything that isn't actual prose is probably [Haskell](https://haskell.org) code, because Haskell is great! All of that code is located in `./src`, and defines how to compile the content to HTML/CSS with various templates.

Prose is written in [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown), and the sources for those live in `./content` alongside [SCSS stylesheets](./content/css) and [HTML templates](./content/templates).

`./docs` is where GitHub hosts the site from; it has all the compiled HTML/CSS/JS, and is only intended to be human-readable via a browser.

## Credits

A huge amount of layout, stylistic choices, and other widgets and bits are borrowed from people who are much better at frontend design than I am. I credit all of these folks in code comments wherever relevant, but I will also try to collect those sources here so that no one has to go digging around for them.

The site itself is generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), which is a static site generator written in Haskell by Jasper Van der Jeugt. Hakyll is under a [BSD license](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll/blob/master/LICENSE), except for the parts that use Pandoc, which are under a matching GPL license.

Page content is compiled to HTML by John MacFarlane's [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), under a [GPL license](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/COPYRIGHT).

The color scheme is [Tomorrow (Night)](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-tomorrow-scheme), by Chris Kempson. Which colors go where is guided by his [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) theme architecture. Both are under an [MIT license](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The syntax highlighting definition for the "PseudoML" language I use in ConceptualFP was adapted more or less directly from Nicholas Wu's [Haskell syntax definition for KDE](https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/blob/master/data/syntax/haskell.xml). This is also under an [MIT license](https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting#licensing).

The CSS shadows under "cards" (and, really, the card concept itself) were adapted from Google's [Material Design spec](https://material.io/components/cards), also under [MIT license](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/LICENSE).

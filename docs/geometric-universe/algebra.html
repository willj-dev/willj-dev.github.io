<h3 id="whats-in-an-algebra">What’s in an Algebra?<a href="#whats-in-an-algebra" class="anchor" title="What’s in an Algebra?">link</a></h3>
<p>An algebra is made of <em>elements</em>, which we normally call by single-letter names like <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>; and <em>operations</em>, like addition and multiplication, along with various rules to describe how these pieces interact.</p>
<p>We can start somewhere familiar: the real numbers, like <span class="math inline">\({}2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Within GA we will refer to these as <em>scalars</em>; this name comes from the fact that multiplying any element by a scalar “scales it” by that factor. Thus, <span class="math inline">\({}3a\)</span> is three times “bigger” (in a somewhat loose way) than <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are also <em>vectors</em>, which will be doing most of the legwork for us.</p>
<h3 id="addition">Addition<a href="#addition" class="anchor" title="Addition">link</a></h3>
<p>We can add elements together; addition is <em>associative</em>, so it doesn’t matter how a series of additions are grouped:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \]</span></p>
<p>and <em>commutative</em>, so it doesn’t matter which order the elements are written in:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a + b = b + a \]</span></p>
<p>Incidentally, addition is still allowed even between mixtures of scalars, vectors, and higher-order elements. Thus, a given element may have a <em>scalar part</em>, a <em>vector part</em>, and so forth. High school vector algebra forbids constructions like <span class="math inline">\({}3 + 2\vec x\)</span>, but from the perspective of GA, this restriction is unnecessary and actually prevents us from accessing some of the neater features we explore below. In fact, if you have worked with complex numbers before, this is exactly the same way that <span class="math inline">\(z = a + ib\)</span> has a <em>real part</em> (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) and an <em>imaginary part</em> (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>), and below we will be able to construct an element that squares to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> without having to artificially include the “imaginary unit” <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by fiat!</p>
<h3 id="multiplication">Multiplication<a href="#multiplication" class="anchor" title="Multiplication">link</a></h3>
<p>Multiplication in GA is going to be where we will start departing more significantly from high school algebra. If you studied physics or vector calculus, you may already be familiar with the existence of multiple “kinds” of multiplication, as in the dot product <span class="math inline">\(\vec a \cdot \vec b\)</span> and the cross product <span class="math inline">\(\vec a \times \vec b\)</span>. In GA, we can interpret these as two sides of one overall <em>geometric product</em>, which we simply write like <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to do so, however, we will need to allow the geometric product to be <em>non-commutative</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ ab \neq ba,\ \text{in general.} \]</span></p>
<p>Of course, we don’t mean to imply that it’s <em>never</em> true—we just need to be careful not to take it for granted. For instance, obviously scalar multiplication still commutes, so that e.g. <span class="math inline">\({}3\times 2 = 2 \times 3 = 6\)</span>. But unless we know that a given element is a scalar, or can commute with adjacent elements for some other reason, we can’t just rearrange products without a care. This may seem like a strange feature to desire in our algebra, but as we shall see, the amount of mileage we can get out of letting go of commutativity in our products is pretty astounding!</p>
<p>The geometric product <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span> is made of two parts: the <em>inner product</em> <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot b\)</span> and the <em>outer product</em> <span class="math inline">\(a \wedge b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ ab = a \cdot b + a \wedge b. \]</span></p>
<p>Like the dot product, the inner product commutes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a \cdot b = b \cdot a. \]</span></p>
<p>And like the cross product, the outer product <em>anticommutes</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a \wedge b = - b \wedge a. \]</span></p>
<p>Fiddling around with these three equations yields</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a \cdot b = \frac{1}{2} (ab + ba) \]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a \wedge b = \frac{1}{2} (ab - ba). \]</span></p>
<p>To be precise, we will treat these last two as the <em>definitions</em> of the inner and outer products, respectively, and the relation <span class="math inline">\(ab = a \cdot b + a \wedge b\)</span> as a consequence of these definitions, rather than the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="distributive-law">Distributive Law<a href="#distributive-law" class="anchor" title="Distributive Law">link</a></h3>
<p>As far as algebraic rules go, one of the mainstays is the good old-fashioned distributive law, which defines one of the main ways that multiplication and addition interact.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a(b + c) = ab + ac \]</span></p>
<p>Unlike its relative the commutative law, we are going to keep this one set in stone; it’s true always.</p>

<p>“Solutions” in GP are specifically solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are generally coupled partial differential equations and, in practice, almost always impossible to solve directly. This makes the GUH, in one sense, disappointing: what’s the point of using math to describe physical laws if all we get out of it is equations we can’t solve? But really it’s not as bad as all that. In fact, there are many ways to information out of these equations without actually solving them; this is essentially what theoretical physics is, and recently we have also been able to tackle them numerically using computer algorithms. Besides, the simple cases that we <em>can</em> solve exactly are still valuable for human understanding. We are in a sense doing the same thing humans usually do when faced with a complicated math problem: break it down into easily digestible chunks, and use mathematical notation to keep track of all the little bits so that we don’t get overwhelmed.</p>

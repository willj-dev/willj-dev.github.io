Eventually, we hope, there will come a time when we can mark the start of the official First Utopian Epoch :)</p><p>As for time scale, let us start with a 128-bit integer and see how much that will get us. First, we can look for some obvious boundaries. Each increment of one Planck time within a single second could be labeled with 144 bits (that is, 21/tp), which is okay because once we’re poking around at that scale, we won’t be limited by such trivia as the number of bits we can afford to spend on timestamps. People are pretty used to using 4 decimal digits to write a year, so let’s say we want to at least be able to count somewhere around that order of years in our epoch. 8192=213, but 13 is an ugly number, so let’s round up to a nice power of 2 like 16. Devoting 16 bits to a year leaves us with 112 bits to divide within each year. This means that our smallest division of time will divide one Earth orbital period into 2112 segments, each equivalent to about 6E-27 seconds, which should be quite adequate for a while. We can now define a conversion constant between Unix milliseconds and 128-bit PUE time:</p><p>kPUE128:Ums=1.64531091023z</p><p>Multiplying Unix millis by this number will give the current “PUE128 time”. Coincidentally, this happens to be on the same order as Avogadro’s number, but I’m pretty sure that’s just a fluke.</p><p>This defines a universal timeline suitable for computers, but doesn’t really satisfy important “real-life” needs that humans are accustomed to. We will need two more time-shaped systems: a solar calendar tied to orbital reference points (such as the two polar solstices each year), which is divided into 12 months, where each month is made of 4 weeks of 7 days. Unfortunately, Earth doesn’t rotate a whole number of times around its own axis in each orbit; if each day is 24 hours, this means that we will need to</p><p>Define one day as the amount of time it takes the earth to move through an orbit according to some published source.</p><p>Then one year is 360 days, with 12 months of 30 days. Divide each day evenly into 24h*60m*60s.</p><p>How long is that second compared to Gregorian? A bit larger, by about 3/20 of a contemporary second. So, doable.</p><p>This is enough to construct a universal timeline tied to a specific reference event and scale.</p>
